  // in the appropriate zone for that time in the given location.
  //
  // The month, day, hour, min, sec, and nsec values may be outside
  // their usual ranges and will be normalized during the conversion.
  // For example, October 32 converts to November 1.

  // For example, in the United States, March 13, 2011 2:15am never occurred,
  // while November 6, 2011 1:15am occurred twice. In such cases, the
  // choice of time zone, and therefore the time, is not well-defined.

  // in the transition, but it does not guarantee which.

  // Date throws an error if loc is nil.
